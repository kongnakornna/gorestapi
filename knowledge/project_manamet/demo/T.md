- [ ] sync.Mutex used correctly (Lock/Unlock pairs)
- [ ] Context passed as first parameter for cancellation

### Performance
- [ ] No unnecessary allocations in hot paths
- [ ] Slice pre-allocated when size known (`make([]T, 0, capacity)`)
- [ ] String concatenation uses `strings.Builder` for large operations
- [ ] Database queries have appropriate indexes
- [ ] No N+1 queries

### Security

- [ ] Sensitive data not logged
- [ ] Passwords hashed with bcrypt (not stored in plaintext)
- [ ] JWT secrets loaded from environment
- [ ] CORS configured properly (allow only trusted origins)

### Testing

- [ ] Table-driven tests used for multiple scenarios
- [ ] Edge cases tested (nil, empty, boundary values)
- [ ] Mock external dependencies
- [ ] Test coverage > 80%

### Project Structure
- [ ] Follows standard Go project layout
- [ ] Packages have single responsibility
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Internal packages used for private code
- [ ] Go modules properly configured

### Dependencies
- [ ] go.mod has only required dependencies
